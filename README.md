# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
 **Champion – Career Edge 2025: Data Voyage Hackathon**



## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for **telecom companies**, where recurring revenue depends heavily on customer retention. This project analyzes telecom customer churn data to identify churn drivers, high-risk customer segments, and actionable retention insights using Excel.

This dashboard was built during the **3-hour Career Edge 2025: Data Voyage hackathon**, which combined **Excel analytics, SQL problem-solving, and dashboard creation** under strict time constraints.



## Hackathon Context & Requirements
This project was developed as part of a competitive hackathon designed to assess analytical, technical, and problem-solving skills.

### Hackathon Structure
- Duration: **3 hours**
- Tasks included:
  - Solving **Excel analytical problems**
  - Solving **SQL queries**
  - Building an **interactive Excel dashboard**
- Dataset provided: <a href="https://github.com/Ishraque03/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Dataset.csv">Customer Churn Dataset</a>

### Section C: Excel Dashboard Creation (Official Requirements)
Participants were required to create a complete Excel dashboard with:

- **Pivot Table:**  
  Count of customers by **Gender (rows)** and **Partner status (columns)**

- **Pivot Chart:**  
  Clustered Column Chart visualizing churn distribution across gender and partner status

- **Key Metric:**  
  Overall Churn Rate calculated as:  
  `Total Churned Customers ÷ Total Customers`

- **Interactivity:**  
  A **Contract Type slicer** linked to the Pivot Table


**Achievement:** *Champion – Career Edge 2025: Data Voyage Hackathon*

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **telecom customer churn** using Excel. The dashboard integrates **Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, and calculated metrics** to provide business-focused insights into customer behavior and retention risks.


## Project Objectives
- Measure overall telecom customer churn rate  
- Identify churn patterns across demographics and subscription attributes  
- Detect high-risk customer segments  
- Build an interactive, decision-oriented Excel dashboard  
- Demonstrate analytical skills under time pressure

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Ishraque03/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Dataset.csv">Customer Churn Dataset</a>

## Instructions
1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/Ishraque03/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Dashboard.xlsx">Customer Churn Dashboard</a> Excel file.
2. Open the Car Sales Performance Dashboard Excel file.
3. Use slicers and filters to explore sales performance by year, region, company, and vehicle attributes.

## Key Business Questions Addressed
- What is the overall churn rate of telecom customers?  
- How does churn vary by **gender and partner status**?  
- Which **contract types** drive the highest churn?  
- Which **internet services** exhibit higher churn risk?  
- Which customer segments should be prioritized for retention strategies?  


## Process
1. Explored and prepared the telecom churn dataset in Excel  
2. Built Pivot Tables to analyze churn by gender, partner status, contract type, and services  
3. Created Pivot Charts for clear visual comparison  
4. Calculated overall churn rate using Excel formulas  
5. Added slicers for interactive contract-based filtering  
6. Designed a dedicated dashboard sheet focused on clarity and storytelling

## Key Insights
- The overall **telecom customer churn rate is 27%**, highlighting a significant retention challenge in the business.
- Customer distribution is nearly evenly split by gender, and **gender alone does not strongly influence churn**, suggesting demographic factors are secondary.
- **Single customers**, particularly **single female customers**, represent a higher churn-risk segment compared to partnered customers.
- **Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn**:
  - Month-to-month contracts show extremely high churn (~43%)
  - One-year contracts reduce churn significantly (~11%)
  - Two-year contracts have the lowest churn (~3%)
- **Fiber Optic customers exhibit the highest churn rate**, despite being the most adopted internet service, indicating potential service quality or pricing concerns.
- **Electronic Check is the most commonly used payment method** and is linked with higher churn.
- Long-term customers with bundled services (e.g., security, tech support) demonstrate comparatively better retention.

## Recommendations
- Introduce **incentives and loyalty programs** to encourage customers to migrate from month-to-month contracts to long-term plans.
- Develop **targeted retention campaigns** for high-risk segments, especially single customers and short-tenure users.
- Conduct deeper analysis into **Fiber Optic service experience**, focusing on pricing, reliability, and customer support.
- Promote **auto-pay and digital payment methods** to reduce friction caused by manual billing processes.
- Offer **bundled value-added services** (security, tech support, streaming) to increase customer stickiness and perceived value.
- Implement early-warning churn indicators based on tenure, contract type, and payment behavior.


## Business Impact
- Reducing churn among month-to-month customers can lead to **significant improvements in recurring revenue stability**.
- Targeted retention strategies are more cost-effective than acquisition, helping reduce **customer acquisition costs (CAC)**.
- Improving Fiber Optic retention can protect revenue from the company’s **highest-adoption service segment**.
- Increased adoption of long-term contracts supports **predictable cash flow and improved customer lifetime value (CLV)**.
- Insights from this dashboard enable **data-driven decisions** across pricing strategy, contract design, and customer engagement.
- The dashboard provides leadership with a **scalable analytical framework** for ongoing churn monitoring.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to deliver **data-driven insights under competitive and time-constrained conditions**. By combining Excel analytics, business understanding, and visual storytelling, I successfully translated telecom customer data into actionable churn insights—earning the **Champion position at the Career Edge 2025: Data Voyage hackathon**.
